## Project Description
This project explores the implementation and optimization of DQNs in a simulated environment, specifically targeting the 'CartPole-v1' environment from OpenAI's gym.

## Contents
- "main.ipynb" : A Jupyter notebook detailing the implementation of the DQN model, including experiments with different network architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
- "utils.py" : A Python script providing utility functions and classes for the DQN model, including a custom Replay Buffer for experience replay.
- "report.pdf" : A comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, hyperparameter tuning strategies, and key findings, augmented with various visualization techniques to illustrate the results and insights.

## Key Features
- Implementation of DQN with various architectures.
- Detailed hyperparameter tuning and analysis.
- Comparative evaluation of model performance across different configurations.
- Evaluation of the final policy enhanced by visualisation techniques.

## Libraries
- PyTorch
- Gym
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
